1) When a user who is not signed in tries to redeem a gym pass, the venue details should persist on the page but a red message should appear above the 'get a gym pass' button saying "Oopsie-daisies! You must be signed in to get a day pass. Please sign in above." Then, if the user goes straight to the sign in page and hits the sign-in button, they should be taken back to the same gym page they were on.

2) Add time zone to redemption code expiration time

3) change units of distance in gym results page from meters to miles

4) sort the gyms on the gyms results page based on distance away from you

5) on the day pass page have a back button that takes users back to their search instead of a search again button that just takes them home

6) make the gyms near on the gym results page a drop down with recently search addresses and last option "enter new address"

7) in gym search results table, be able to click on photo and have it take you to venue details page
