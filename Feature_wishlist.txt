1) When a user who is not signed in tries to redeem a gym pass, the venue details should persist on the page but a red message should appear above the 'get a gym pass' button saying "Oopsie-daisies! You must be signed in to get a day pass. Please sign in above." Then, if the user goes straight to the sign in page and hits the sign-in button, they should be taken back to the same gym page they were on.

2) Add time zone to redemption code expiration time
